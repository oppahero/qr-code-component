## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Continued development

For future projects I want to continue focusing on other CSS properties, like grid. I also want to implement mobile-first workflow.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - I'd recommend it to anyone still learning about css.
